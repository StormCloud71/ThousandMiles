This was created just for fun and spite. Mostly spite. To prove to myself, first and foremost, that I can code in C#. It started as a weighted randomizer, complete with JSON loading weights.

Where it will end? I don't know.

If you want to run it, please create an Objects.Json in your Documents folder. The JSON should contain a list with elements in the form {"Name":<some string>,"Weight":<some numeral>},
