# A Thousand Miles
## An educational, kludgy, mini RPG in C#

My skills in C# are thought iffy at best, non existent at worst. I am no Mae Muller, so I can't write a song. I could paint a picture, but maybe later. So, I decided to write a mini TextRPG.
It would be a better way to learn, debug, mess with stuff, deepen my understanding of objects and inheritance and plainly have fun.

It currently reads a few files, creates a random object and greets the adventurer. Just that.
